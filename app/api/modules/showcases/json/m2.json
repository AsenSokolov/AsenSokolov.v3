I did a very good organisation of their products and separated them into categories. All users have the freedom to search and filter every single category and find the best product for their needs.<br/><br/>I developed the website to be mobile friendly, speed optimised with various cache techniques so the users can have best possible experience and SEO optimisations so the client can arrange their own meta tags, keywords, descriptions.<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT DEVELOPED BY:</strong> Asen Sokolov",
