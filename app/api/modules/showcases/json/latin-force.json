  "typographyDescr": "Arial, sometimes marketed or displayed in software as Arial MT, is a sans-serif typeface and set of computer fonts. The typeface was designed in 1982 by a 10-person team, led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography. It was created to be metrically identical to the popular typeface Helvetica, with all character widths identical, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without having to pay for a Helvetica license.",

  "creativeDescr": "<strong>PROJECT ASSIGNMENT:</strong> Design and develop a user friendly dance studio website with main goal to inform students/website visitors about upcoming classes and events.<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> The most challenging part of this project was the dynamic class table. Latin Force have a lot of classes, several training halls and I had to figure it out how to design it in a way that all users can find what they are searching for. I developed custom widget where my client can administrate all dance classes, their instructors and locations, all this wrapped in user friendly interface.<br/><br/>Since the launch of the website Latin Force significantly increased  the number of their users (more than 2500 unique users per mo) and formed a very active community of people interested in their work and events.<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT DEVELOPED BY:</strong> Asen Sokolov",
