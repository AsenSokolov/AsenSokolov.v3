  "typographyDescr": "Arial, sometimes marketed or displayed in software as Arial MT, is a sans-serif typeface and set of computer fonts. The typeface was designed in 1982 by a 10-person team, led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography. It was created to be metrically identical to the popular typeface Helvetica, with all character widths identical, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without having to pay for a Helvetica license.",
