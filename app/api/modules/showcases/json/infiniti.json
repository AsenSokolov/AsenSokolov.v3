  "generalInfo": "Infiniti is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Nissan. Infiniti officially started selling vehicles on November 8, 1989 in North America. The marketing network for Infiniti-branded vehicles now includes over 230 dealers in over 15 countries.<br/><br/>Infiniti believe a luxury vehicle should connect you to the road, not insulate you from it. It should put you in charge, not take charge. It should make your heart beat faster, not lull you to sleep. Infiniti's pioneering spirit boldly breaks from convention to create something more distinctive. <br/><br/>More alive.",

  "typographyDescr": "Arial, sometimes marketed or displayed in software as Arial MT, is a sans-serif typeface and set of computer fonts. The typeface was designed in 1982 by a 10-person team, led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography. It was created to be metrically identical to the popular typeface Helvetica, with all character widths identical, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without having to pay for a Helvetica license.",

  "creativeDescr": "<strong>PROJECT ASSIGNMENT:</strong> Design and develop Facebook application illustrating the users activity from the past year.<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> The challenge was to raise the fan base and make it personal. Infiniti wanted to give a great prize – a trip for 2 to a destination of winner’s choice. That prize had to go to the most active and engaged user.<br/><br/>We developed a custom application which allowed users to see their social engagement through a personalised animated infographic based on their activity over the past year. The custom infographic extracted the users Facebook data from the past year and was presented in a very stylish and innovative way. All the components are 100% custom made.<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT DEVELOPED BY:</strong> XEC-STUDIO",
